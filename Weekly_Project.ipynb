        "### Dataset Overview\n",
        "The RTA Dataset provides a detailed snapshot of road traffic accidents, capturing a range of data from accident conditions to casualty details. This dataset is essential for analyzing patterns and causes of accidents to improve road safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Characteristics\n",
        "- **Entries**: The dataset contains 12,316 entries.\n",
        "- **Features**: There are 32 features in the dataset, which include:\n",
        "  - `Time`: Time when the accident occurred.\n",
        "  - `Day_of_week`: Day of the week.\n",
        "  - `Age_band_of_driver`: Age group of the driver involved.\n",
        "  - `Sex_of_driver`: Gender of the driver.\n",
        "  - `Educational_level`: Educational level of the driver.\n",
        "  - `Type_of_vehicle`: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.\n",
        "  - `Cause_of_accident`: Reported cause of the accident.\n",
        "  - `Accident_severity`: Severity of the accident.\n",
        "- **Target Column**: `Accident_severity` is used as the target column for modeling. This feature classifies the severity of each accident.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "Students will use this dataset to apply various data visualization, modeling, and evaluation techniques learned in class. The primary goal is to build models that can accurately predict the severity of accidents and to identify the key factors that contribute to severe accidents."

        "- **Handling Missing Values**: Replace missing values with appropriate statistics (mean, median, mode) or use more complex imputation techniques.\n",
        "- **Normalization/Scaling**: Scale data to a small, specified range like 0 to 1, or transform it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
        "- **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical text data into model-understandable numbers where the labels are ordered.\n",
        "- **One-Hot Encoding**: Use for nominal categorical data where no ordinal relationship exists to transform the data into a binary column for each category. (Be careful not to increase the dimensionality significantly)\n",
        "- **Detection and Treatment of Outliers**: Use statistical tests, box plots, or scatter plots to identify outliers and then cap, trim, or use robust methods to reduce the effect of outliers, depending on the context.\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance your dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones. This might involve combining data from different columns, applying transformations, or reducing dimensionality with techniques like PCA to improve model performance.\n",

        "To assess model performance for predicting the age band and sex of casualties, we compared metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for each model. The model with the highest accuracy, precision, and recall was selected as the best performer for our dataset, which involves categorical variables related to casualties. We encountered trade-offs in terms of computational efficiency, with some models requiring more resources and time for training, while others offered easier implementation but less interpretability. Our choice of the best model was based on its balance between performance metrics and practical considerations, such as ease of deployment and interpretability. For the best-performing model, feature importance analysis revealed that variables like age band had a significant impact on predictions. Visualizations supported this by showing strong correlations between age bands and casualty outcomes. Limitations included potential biases in the dataset and difficulties in handling imbalanced classes. Future improvements could involve exploring alternative algorithms, enhancing feature engineering, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to address these limitations and further boost model performance."
